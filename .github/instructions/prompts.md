## ðŸ”§ Debugging Prompts

### Translation Accuracy Issues

```
A user reports that "[SPECIFIC_TRANSLATION]" is not accurate for Singapore context. Debug this issue:

INVESTIGATION STEPS:

5. Validate against Singapore native speaker expectations

SINGAPORE CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
- Are local terms being translated when they should be preserved?
- Is the cultural meaning maintained in the translation?
- Does the translation sound natural to Singapore speakers?
- Are there better alternatives that fit local usage?

TESTING APPROACH:
- Test with variations of the phrase
- Check different formality levels
- Validate with multiple language pairs
- Get feedback from Singapore community members

Provide a detailed analysis and proposed solution that improves translation accuracy for Singapore users.
