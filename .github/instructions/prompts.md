### Kopi Slang Generation Logic Prompt

```
You are developing the kopi slang generation logic for a Singapore coffee ordering app. Your task is to create functions that accurately convert dropdown selections into authentic kopi terminology:

CORE GENERATION RULES:
- Base drinks: "Kopi" (coffee), "Teh" (tea), "Milo" (chocolate malt)
- Milk modifiers: Default (condensed milk), "-C" (evaporated milk), "-O" (no milk)
- Sugar modifiers: Default (normal), "Kosong" (no sugar), "Siu Dai" (less sweet), "Gah Dai" (extra sweet)
- Temperature: Default (hot), "Peng" (iced)

COMBINATION RULES:
- Order matters: Base + Milk + Sugar + Temperature
- Examples: "Kopi-O Kosong Peng" = Black iced coffee with no sugar
- "Teh-C Siu Dai" = Tea with evaporated milk, less sweet
- "Milo Peng" = Iced Milo (chocolate malt drink)

AUTHENTICITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Use exact spelling and capitalization as used in real kopitiams
- Maintain proper spacing between modifiers
- Handle edge cases (e.g., Milo typically doesn't use milk modifiers)
- Ensure generated slang matches what locals actually use

VALIDATION PRINCIPLES:
- Every combination should be a real order someone would make
- Generated slang should sound natural to Singapore coffee shop workers
- Maintain consistency with traditional kopitiam terminology
- Handle unusual combinations gracefully

Generate functions that produce authentic, culturally-accurate kopi slang from user selections.
