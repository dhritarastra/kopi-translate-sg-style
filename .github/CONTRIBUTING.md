## Kopi Culture Guidelines

### Singapore Kopitiam Considerations

When contributing kopi slang improvements:

1. **Maintain authenticity**: Ensure all generated slang matches real kopitiam usage
   - "Kopi-O" means black coffee (no milk)
   - "Kopi-C" means coffee with evaporated milk
   - "Kosong" means no sugar
   - "Siu Dai" means less sweet
   - "Gah Dai" means extra sweet
   - "Peng" means iced

2. **Respect traditional ordering**:
   - Understand the proper order of modifiers
   - Know which combinations are authentic
   - Maintain cultural respect for kopitiam traditions

3. **Cultural sensitivity**:
   - Be aware of kopitiam etiquette
   - Respect coffee shop worker terminology
   - Understand local coffee culture context

4. **Educational value**:
   - Help users learn proper kopi ordering
   - Provide clear explanations for slang terms
   - Make kopitiam culture accessible to tourists and newcomers

### Drink Variations Priority

1. **Core drinks**: Kopi, Teh, Milo
2. **Milk variations**: Default (condensed), -C (evaporated), -O (no milk)
3. **Sugar levels**: Normal, Kosong, Siu Dai, Gah Dai
4. **Temperature**: Hot (default), Peng (iced)
