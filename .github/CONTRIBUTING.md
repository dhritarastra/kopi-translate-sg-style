### Translation Improvements

We especially welcome contributions that improve translation accuracy for Singapore context:

- **Cultural context**: Enhance cultural sensitivity in translations
- **Food terminology**: Better handling of local food names and descriptions

## Translation Guidelines

### Singapore-Specific Considerations

When contributing translation improvements:

1. **Preserve local context**: Don't over-translate Singapore-specific terms
   - "HDB" should remain "HDB" in most cases
   - "Kopitiam" should remain "kopitiam"
   - "MRT" should remain "MRT"

2. **Handle Singlish appropriately**: 
   - Understand when to preserve Singlish expressions
   - Know when to provide standard translations
   - Maintain the spirit of the original expression

3. **Cultural sensitivity**:
   - Be aware of cultural nuances
   - Respect religious and cultural references
   - Understand local humor and expressions

4. **Food and dining**:
   - Preserve authentic food names when appropriate
   - Provide context when helpful
   - Understand hawker center terminology

### Language Pairs Priority

1. **English â†” Chinese (Simplified)**
2. **English â†” Chinese (Traditional)**
3. **English â†” Malay**
4. **English â†” Tamil**
