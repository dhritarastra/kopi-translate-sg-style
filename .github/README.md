## 🎯 Translation Philosophy

### What Makes Us Different

1. **Context Preservation**: We don't just translate words, we preserve meaning
2. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Understanding when NOT to translate certain terms
3. **Local Expertise**: Built with deep understanding of Singapore culture
4. **Community-Driven**: Improved by and for the Singapore community

### Examples

❌ **Generic Translator**:
- "I'm going to the kopitiam" → "I'm going to the coffee shop"
- "Take MRT to Orchard" → "Take subway to Orchard"

✅ **Kopi Translate SG Style**:
- "I'm going to the kopitiam" → "我要去咖啡店" (preserving local context)
- "Take MRT to Orchard" → "搭地铁去乌节路" (using local transport terms)
